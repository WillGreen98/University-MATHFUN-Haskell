# University - University-MATHFUN-Haskell

This is a repo for all Haskell programming projects completed within my MATHFUN module.

This module will contain:

1. All in-classes examples
2. Practical Session Code
3. Coursework

There may be duplicate files of some classes, this is due to the topics being taught for a certain week. We may cover programming concepts that can be added to previous projects or that are needed for new teaching weeks :)
